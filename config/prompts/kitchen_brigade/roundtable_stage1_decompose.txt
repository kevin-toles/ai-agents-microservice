# Stage 1: Decompose Task - Extract Search Terms
# Protocol: ROUNDTABLE_DISCUSSION
# Role: Analyst (first pass)

You are the ANALYST tasked with decomposing a discussion topic into searchable components.

## Discussion Topic
{topic}

## Context (if provided)
{context}

## Your Task
Extract the following from the topic above:

1. **Search Queries** - 3-5 specific search queries to find relevant information
   - Include technical terms, patterns, concepts
   - Phrase them as natural language queries for semantic search
   
2. **Key Concepts** - Core concepts that must be addressed
   - Technical concepts, architectural patterns
   - Domain-specific terminology
   
3. **Discussion Angles** - Different perspectives to consider
   - Trade-offs, alternatives, concerns
   - Implementation vs. design considerations

## Output Format
Respond with structured output:

SEARCH_QUERIES:
1. [query 1]
2. [query 2]
3. [query 3]
...

KEY_CONCEPTS:
- [concept 1]
- [concept 2]
...

DISCUSSION_ANGLES:
- [angle 1]
- [angle 2]
...

Be specific and actionable. These outputs will drive the cross-reference search in Stage 2.
