YOUR TASK - ROUND 2 (Rebuttal):
Now that you've heard the opposing side's arguments, respond directly.

{{role}} specific instructions:
- If you are the PROPOSER: Rebut the OPPOSER's arguments and strengthen your case
- If you are the OPPOSER: Rebut the PROPOSER's arguments and strengthen your case

Your rebuttal should:
- Directly address the opponent's strongest points
- Expose weaknesses in their reasoning
- Strengthen your own arguments with additional evidence
- Acknowledge any valid points they made (intellectual honesty)
- CITE ALL EVIDENCE using [^N] format - unsupported rebuttals are weak
