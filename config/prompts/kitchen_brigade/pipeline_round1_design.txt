YOUR TASK - ROUND 1 (Architecture Design):
Create a comprehensive design for this task.

Your design should include:
- High-level architecture overview
- Component breakdown with responsibilities
- Data structures and interfaces
- Flow/sequence of operations
- Error handling strategy
- Edge cases to consider

Do NOT write implementation code yet - focus on design.
