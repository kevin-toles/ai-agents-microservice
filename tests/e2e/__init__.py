"""End-to-End Protocol Integration Tests.

WBS-PI7: End-to-End Protocol Testing

These tests validate the complete Protocol Integration Architecture:
- A2A Protocol (Agent Card, Task Lifecycle, Streaming)
- MCP Protocol (Server, Client, Semantic Search)
- Feature Flag behavior (enabled, disabled, partial)
- Phase 1 stability (always functional regardless of Phase 2 state)
